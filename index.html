        <h3 class = "introtext">My name is Matthew Bouwmeister. I'm an aspiring video game developer,
                                with some pep in his step, and a positive attitude on the mind! I'm a student at Mohawk college,
                                enrolled in the Computer Systems Technology : Software Development course. I'm always eager to start
                                new projects whether they be simple, complex, easy, or hard. I'm looking forward to when 
                                our paths may someday cross!
